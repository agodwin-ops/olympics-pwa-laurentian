# üö® URGENT: Frontend Changes Not Deployed

## The Problem
Your recent fixes are **NOT LIVE** because only the backend API is deployed to Render.

**Current Deployment:**
- ‚úÖ Backend (FastAPI): Live on Render
- ‚ùå Frontend (Next.js): Only running locally

## Why Your Fixes Don't Work in Production:
1. **XP Persistence Fix**: Frontend transformation code not deployed
2. **Session Persistence**: Frontend auth context not deployed  
3. **Batch Student UI**: Frontend components not deployed
4. **Assignment Deletion**: Backend API works, but frontend UI not deployed

## Quick Solutions:

### üöÄ Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended - 5 minutes)
1. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in with GitHub
2. Click "Import Project" 
3. Select your `olympics-pwa-laurentian` repository
4. Configure:
   - **Framework**: Next.js
   - **Root Directory**: `apps/web`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `.next`
5. Add Environment Variable:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = `https://your-render-url.onrender.com`
6. Deploy!

### üîß Option 2: Update Render (10 minutes)
1. Change `render.yaml` to use `Dockerfile.fullstack` 
2. This will serve both frontend and backend from one service

### üè† Option 3: Test Locally Only
Run `cd apps/web && npm run dev` to test changes locally

## Get Your Render Backend URL:
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Find your `claudable-olympics-pwa` service  
3. Copy the URL (looks like `https://something.onrender.com`)
4. Use this as `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Vercel

## After Frontend Deployment:
‚úÖ XP values will persist on admin relogin  
‚úÖ Sessions won't logout on browser refresh
‚úÖ Batch student upload will work with new UI
‚úÖ Assignment deletion buttons will appear

**The commits pushed fine - you just need to deploy the frontend separately!**
